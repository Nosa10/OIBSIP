# OIBSIP
This is a repository of the projects I worked on during my Internship with Oasis Infobyte. 
In the first project I worked on exploratory Data Analysis on a Sales dataset. 
In the second project, I worked on Exploratory Data Analysis on New York Traffic Data. 
In the third project, I used Unsupervised Machine learning for a customer segmentation Task. 
In the fourth project, I used linear regression task to predict the price of houses based on selected features. 
For each of the projects, I ensured the data was cleaned and reliable before starting my analysis. 
Each of the Project have insights and/or recommendations in their notebooks.
